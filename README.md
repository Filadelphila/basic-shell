# Basic-Shell
A simple/basic minimal linux shell.
## How to install ?
Simply run `make` into the project, it will build the `basic-shell` executable shell.
## Do I need some libs ?
I can not really answer, it must work on all Linux distribution with the minimal develepment libraries installed.
If any particular library is needed it will likely tell you so, do not worry.
## Is this shell customizable ?
Not at all.
## Inspiration
